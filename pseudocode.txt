Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

Goal: Create a basic web application to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors

Constraints:
  - Create a function called getComputerChoice for a "computer" player
  - Function with inputs "playerSelection" and "computerSelection"
  - Declare who wins, example: "You lose! Paper beats Rock"
  - Make the parameter of the function case-insensitive
  - The length of the game is 5 rounds (best of 5)

Pseudo Code:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats rocks

A simple if statement or switch should be able to handle this. Can create
a function called checkResult(playerSelection, computerSelection).

getComputerChoice should be a random function that provides a value between
1 - 3. Each value will be rock/paper/Scissors.

playerSelection should be gathered with a prompt().

A while loop can be used to cover the length of the game. When the player
or the computer hits 3 then the game is over. Check if computerWins or playerWins
is equal to 5 to break() the loop.

Then the results can be displayed on the page using a function or alert.

Functions to make:
  - checkResult: Determines who won, should update and return a list [computerWin, playerWin]
  - getComputerChoice: Outputs the computerSelection input
  - game: Starts and manages a 5 round game and uses the above functions, exits on 3 distinct wins

Game Theme Ideas:
  - Star Wars
  - 8Bit
  - Elements
  - Kung Fu/Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat/Smash Bros <-
